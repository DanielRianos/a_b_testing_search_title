# :man_scientist: A/B/C Test: Spiced search results - changing title color

Spiced Academy wants to assess whether the change in the color of the link impacts the number of visits to the website coming from the Google search engine (hypothesis). 

The A/B test collects data for 30 days from two sample groups: one with a purple and another with a blue link. 

#### Disclaimer: This study case as well as the datasets were provided by Spiced Academy as part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp (July- September 2022).
